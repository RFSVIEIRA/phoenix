About:
PHOENIX is a THEME for RetroFeVLC, forged in fire and reborn from the ashes. Just like the mythical bird, it symbolizes a new beginning — bringing back the classics with renewed strength and energy.
Fueled by nostalgia and rage, PHOENIX captures the raw power of old-school gaming while rising higher with every play.

It’s not just about playing — it’s about rising in power every time you press start.

From the ashes, power rises.
